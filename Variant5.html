Ten Principles for <br><b>Good Design</b><br>
<em>Dieter Rams</em>
<br>
<!-- ....... Paragraph 1 ....... --> 
    <b>Good Design</b><br> is innovative.
The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design</b><br>. But innovative <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design</b><br> always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 2 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> makes a product useful. 
A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. <br><b>Good Design</b><br> emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 3 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is aesthetic.
    
The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 4 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> makes a product understandable.
    
It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 5 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is unobtrusive.

Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design</b><br> should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 6 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is honest.
    
It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 7 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is long-lasting.
    
It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  Unlike fashionable <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design</b><br>, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 8 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is thorough down to the last detail.

Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design</b><br> process show respect towards the consumer.
        
<!-- ....... Paragraph 9 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is environmentally friendly.

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design</b><br> makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

<!-- ....... Paragraph 10 ....... --> 
    <br><b>Good Design</b><br> is as little design as possible.  
    
Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
