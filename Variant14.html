<div id="Parchment"><h1 id="title">Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
    <br> <h2 id="Author" >Dieter Rams</h2>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 1 ....... --> 
   <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaOne">Good Design is innovative.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="One">The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.<br> Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design.<br> But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 2 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaTwo">Good Design makes a product useful.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Two">A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic.<br> Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 3 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaThree">Good Design is aesthetic.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Three">The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p></div></div>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 4 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaFour">Good Design makes a product understandable.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Four">It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 5 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaFive">Good Design is<br> unobtrusive.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Five">Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative <br>objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral<br> and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 6 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaSix">Good Design is<br> honest.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Six">It does not make a product more innovative,<br> powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt<br> to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p></div></div>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 7 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaSeven">Good Design is long-lasting.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Seven">It avoids being fashionable and <br>therefore never appears antiquated.<br> Unlike fashionable design, it lasts <br>many years - even in today's <br>throwaway society.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 8 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaEight">Good Design is<br> thorough down to<br> the last detail.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Eight">Nothing must be arbitrary or left to<br> chance. Care and accuracy in the<br> design process show respect<br> towards the consumer.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 9 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaNine">Good Design is<br> environmentally <br>friendly.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Nine">Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p></div></div>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 10 ....... --> 
    <div class="Subtitles"><h2 id="ParaTen">Good Design is<br> as little design<br> as possible.</h2>
       <div class="Subtext"><p id="Ten">Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.<br> Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p></div></div>
