<h1>Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
    <h4><em>Dieter Rams</em></h4>
</div>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 1 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is innovative.</h2>
<p>
    <em>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. 
    <br>Technological development is always offering new opportunities 
    <br> for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in 
    <br> tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 2 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design makes a product useful.</h2>
<p>
    <em>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,
    <br> not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design 
    <br> emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding 
    <br> anything that could possibly detract from it. </em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 3 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is aesthetic.</h2>
<p>
    <em>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because
    <br> products we use every day affect our person and our well-being.
    <br> But only well-executed objects can be beautiful. </em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 4 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design makes a product understandable.</h2>       
<p>
    <em>It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can 
    <br> make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory. </em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 5 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is unobtrusive.</h2>
<p>
    <em>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
    <br> objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both 
    <br> neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression. </em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 6 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is honest.</h2>
<p>
    <em>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it
    <br> really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises
    <br> that cannot be kept.</em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 7 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is long-lasting.</h2>
<p>
    <em>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  Unlike
    <br> fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 8 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is thorough down to the last detail.</h2>
<p> 
    <em>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design 
    <br> process show respect towards the consumer.</em><p>

        
<!-- ....... Paragraph 9 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is environmentally friendly.</h2>
<p>
    <em>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the 
    <br> environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual 
    <br> pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</em></p>


<!-- ....... Paragraph 10 ....... --> 
    <h2>Good Design is as little design as possible.</h2>
<p>
    <em>Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products 
    <br> are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</em></p>
