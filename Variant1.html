<h>Ten Principles for Good Design</h>
   <br> <h>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieter Rams</h>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 1 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is innovative.</h>
<p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. <br> Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. <br>  But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 2 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design makes a product useful.</h>
<p>A product is bought to be used. <br>  It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. <br>  Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 3 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is aesthetic.</h>
<p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. <br> But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 4 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design makes a product understandable.</h>
<p>It clarifies the product's structure.<br>  Better still, it can make the product talk. <br>  At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>
<div><br></div>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 5 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is unobtrusive.</h>
<p>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools.<br> They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. <br>Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 6 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is honest.</h>
<p>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. <br>  It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
<div><br></div>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 7 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is long-lasting.</h>
<p>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  <br>  Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 8 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is thorough down to the last detail.</h>
<p>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. <br>  Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 9 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is environmentally friendly.</h>
<p>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment.<br>  It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 10 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is as little design as possible.</h>
<p>Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. <br>  Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p>
