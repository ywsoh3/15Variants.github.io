<h>Ten Principles for Good Design</h>
   <br> <h>Dieter Rams</h>
<br>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 1 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is innovative.</h>
<h>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. <br> Technological development is always offering new opportunities <br> for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in <br> tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 2 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design makes a product useful.</h>
<h>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,<br> not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design <br> emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding <br> anything that could possibly detract from it.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 3 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is aesthetic.</h>
<h>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because <br> products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. <br> But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 4 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design makes a product understandable.</h>
<h>It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can <br> make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</h>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 5 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is unobtrusive.</h>
<h>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative <br> objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both <br> neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 6 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is honest.</h>
<h>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it <br> really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises <br> that cannot be kept.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 7 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is long-lasting.</h>
<h>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  Unlike <br> fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 8 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is thorough down to the last detail.</h>
<h>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design <br> process show respect towards the consumer.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 9 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is environmentally friendly.</h>
<h>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the <br> environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual <br> pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</h>
<br>

<!-- ....... Paragraph 10 ....... --> 
    <h>Good Design is as little design as possible.</h>
<h>Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products <br> are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</h>
